# Mushroom-Classification-Using-Machine-Learning
I have used Streamlit to create a web app
The binary classification predicts whether the mushroom is poisonous or edible.

The Machine Learning Algorithms involved are :
1. Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
2. Logistic Regression
3. Random Forest Classifier

The web app shows the results such as :
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall

The web app allows you to change different hyperparameters and lets you observe the changes in the 
above results.

Other than this, it also includes various plots such as:
1. Confusion  Matrix
2. ROC curve
3. Precision-Recall Curve
